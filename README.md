# CSCA_5622_Final_Project

This is a Supervised Machine Learning problem and the task is classification. The goal of this project is to evaluate several machine learning models such as KNN,Decision Trees, Ensemble Boosting alrogirthm (AdaBoost), and finally a Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm to predict whether a person has Diabetes based on a number of lifestyle features.
